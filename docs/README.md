# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to OctoAcme’s project management documentation. This repository centralizes repeatable, actionable knowledge for running cross-functional projects—from initiation through delivery, release, risk management, and continuous improvement—using industry-proven workflows refined for OctoAcme’s needs.

## Project Management Summary

OctoAcme’s process centers around a structured lifecycle: define a clear business need, align stakeholders, establish measurable objectives, and create a lightweight plan via a Project One-pager and risk register. Planning focuses on breaking work into shippable increments, estimating scope, marking dependencies, and mapping milestones. Project managers (PM), product managers (PdM), developers, QA, and stakeholders each play defined roles in planning, delivery, and reporting.

Execution uses a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), sprints or milestones, and regular syncs to manage progress and resolve risks. Daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates ensure timely communication and prompt blocker escalation. All code changes run through automated CI for tests, security scans, and require approval to merge. Release and deployment workflows mandate smoke tests, rollbacks, documentation, and blameless incident retrospectives.

Quality assurance is integral: new logic gets automated tests, critical flows have end-to-end and integration testing, and manual QA gates release. **Continuous improvement** is driven by regular retrospectives after each sprint, release, or milestone. In these, the team captures learnings—what went well, what could be improved, and clear action items with owners and due dates. Improvements and actions are tracked in the backlog or as issues, reviewed in regular syncs, and celebrated when completed. This feedback loop ensures OctoAcme’s project management processes are living documentation, evolving as the team identifies opportunities to enhance delivery, communication, and quality.
